      "description": "This program represents a large cluster of genes encoding structural and regulatory components of motile cilia axonemes. The genes include multiple CFAP (cilia and flagella associated protein) family members (CFAP43, CFAP52, CFAP61, CFAP73, CFAP206, CFAP47, CFAP221, CFAP157, CFAP100), dynein arm proteins (DNAH12, DNAH5, DRC1, DNAAF1), radial spoke components (RSPH1), and axonemal assembly regulators (TTC29, TOGARAM2, LRRIQ1). These proteins collectively assemble and regulate the 9+2 microtubule structure characteristic of motile cilia. While motile cilia are not typically associated with differentiated glioblastoma cells, primary cilia play critical roles in glioma biology through Hedgehog signaling and other pathways. The aberrant expression of motile ciliary genes may reflect dedifferentiation, stem-like features, or ectopic developmental program activation in malignant glioblastoma.",
