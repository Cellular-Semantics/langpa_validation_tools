The coordinated expression of metalloprotease genes (ADAM33, ADAMTSL1, ADAMTS14, MMP17) alongside ECM structural components (collagen, proteoglycans) and adhesion molecules suggests this program enables glioma cells to both degrade and reorganize the ECM to facilitate migration. In OPC-like tumor cells, this may represent either adaptation of normal developmental cell migration programs or dysregulation of tissue-remodeling capacity normally required for axonal ensheathment during myelination.",
