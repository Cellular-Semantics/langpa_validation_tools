## Heatmap availability

Matplotlib is not available in the current environment, so graphical heatmaps were not generated automatically. To render them later, install `matplotlib` inside `.venv` (or another environment) and run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_heatmaps.py
```

This will create `analysis/confusion_heatmaps/*.png` files where each plot uses bubble size to indicate the number of overlapping genes, color to indicate Jaccard fraction, and axis labels/legends that show the run IDs plus gene counts (parentheses) for each program.
