## Program Summaries
### Oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation
A developmental transcriptional program that specifies cells toward the oligodendrocyte lineage and promotes myelination. This program includes master transcriptional regulators (MYRF, SOX6), structural myelin proteins (MOG, OMG, BCAS1, CLDN11), and enzymes essential for myelin lipid synthesis (UGT8, FA2H). In GBM context, dysregulation of this program reflects aberrant recapitulation of developmental processes and may be associated with cells occupying an uncommitted developmental state.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Dysregulated recapitulation of developmental oligodendrocyte specification in infiltrative tumor regions
- Aberrant myelin lipid synthesis contributing to altered membrane composition and metabolic dependence
- Enhanced stemness and reduced differentiation commitment in infiltrative GBM cells

### Notch signaling and neural stem cell maintenance
The Notch pathway acts as a critical regulator of neural progenitor self-renewal and inhibition of differentiation in developing CNS. In GBM, elevated Notch signaling through ligands DLL1 and DLL3 maintains cancer stem cell properties and is particularly enriched in infiltrative tumor regions. This program operates downstream of ASCL1 and OLIG2, which are co-expressed transcriptional regulators that determine cellular plasticity and lineage specification in GBM.

### Synaptic adhesion and neuronal crosstalk
GBM cells establish bidirectional communication with neurons through synaptic adhesion molecules and neurotrophic factors. This program includes cell adhesion molecules (ALCAM, LRRC7, MDGA2), guidance molecules (SLIT1, SEMA3E), and neuropeptide receptors (TACR1) that mediate neuron-tumor interactions. Active neuronal activity promotes GBM proliferation through secretion of factors including neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) and activation of growth factor pathways, establishing a tumor microenvironment permissive for GBM growth.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Ion homeostasis and osmotic cell volume regulation
GBM cells rely on ion channels and water transporters to regulate intracellular osmolarity and cell volume during migration through confined brain parenchyma and at leading edge of invasion. This program includes aquaporins (AQP4), cation channels (ANO3, ANO4, TRPC4, CACNA1E), anion channels, and ion exchangers (SLC8A3, SLC5A4, SLC26A7). Proper ion homeostasis is essential for lamellipodial dynamics, cell shape changes, and migration through narrow extracellular spaces.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Cell cycle progression and proliferation
Cell cycle regulation in GBM is controlled by cyclin-CDK complexes, with cyclin D1 (CCND1) being a proto-oncogene frequently dysregulated in GBM. CCND1 drives progression from G1 to S phase by phosphorylating retinoblastoma protein (pRb). CDCA7L (cell division cycle-associated 7 like) is a c-MYC target that promotes proliferation by upregulating CCND1. Elevated cyclin D1 is associated with poor prognosis, enhanced invasiveness, and reduced apoptosis in GBM.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Accelerated progression through G1/S checkpoint in GBM cells
- Enhanced proliferative capacity and increased tumor growth rate
- Increased drug resistance through upregulation of multidrug resistance proteins
- Reduced apoptotic sensitivity to pro-death signals
- Contribution to poor clinical prognosis and shorter survival

**Supporting genes:** CCND1, CDCA7L

### Extracellular matrix remodeling and vasculature assembly
The GBM tumor microenvironment is characterized by extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and abnormal vasculature. Collagen types I, IV, and XX are abundant in GBM and contribute to tumor stiffness, invasion, and vascular abnormalities. This program includes fibrillar collagens (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL20A1), basement membrane components (LAMB4), ECM glycoproteins (TNR, THSD4), and ECM remodeling enzymes (ADAMTS17, HS6ST2). ECM composition and organization influence cell migration, vascular permeability, and therapeutic resistance.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration
Cell migration and invasion in GBM are fundamentally dependent on integrin-ECM interactions that link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. Integrins like ITGA9 (α9β1 heterodimer) interact with ECM components including thrombospondin, fibronectin, and VEGF isoforms. FERMT1 (fermitin family homolog 1, also called kindlin-1) is a FERM-domain protein that binds integrin cytoplasmic tails and cooperates with talin to activate integrins. This program coordinates cell adhesion dynamics with cell-matrix signaling to enable migration.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced cell-matrix adhesion enabling stable interactions with ECM during migration
- Increased integrin signaling (β1/β3) promoting proliferation and survival
- Rapid adhesion turnover allowing efficient migration through tissue
- Sustained migratory phenotype through integrin-dependent signaling
- Modulation of cell morphology and actin dynamics at leading edge

### Lipid metabolism and myelin-derived nutrient scavenging
GBM, particularly mesenchymal-like (MES) GBM cells, exhibit altered lipid metabolism that enables them to utilize myelin-derived lipids from the tumor microenvironment. Lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) internalize myelin debris and transfer cholesterol and fatty acids to GBM cells through metabolic symbiosis. This program involves lipid biosynthetic enzymes (PLA2G4A, PLPP4, PLAAT1, DGKB, FA2H) that remodel lipids for membrane synthesis and metabolic signaling. The liver X receptor (LXR) pathway activates macrophage myelin uptake, creating a tumor-macrophage metabolic axis.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced membrane biosynthesis supporting rapid proliferation
- Utilization of exogenous myelin lipids reducing dependence on de novo lipogenesis
- Altered signaling lipid composition modulating proliferation and survival pathways
- Metabolic symbiosis between MES-like GBM cells and lipid-laden macrophages
- Reduced oxidative stress through lipid remodeling
- Enhanced mesenchymal phenotype and invasiveness

**Supporting genes:** PLA2G4A, PLPP4, PLAAT1, DGKB, FA2H, UGT8

### Growth factor receptor signaling networks
GBM cells exhibit dysregulation of multiple growth factor receptor pathways including EGFR, FGF receptors, and ErbB receptors that drive proliferation, survival, and migration. FGF12 is an intracellular FGF homologous factor (FHF) that modulates intracellular signaling. ERBB3 (HER3) is a neuregulin receptor that heterodimerizes with other ErbB family members to activate PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MAPK pathways. VIPR2 is a G-protein coupled receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) that activates cAMP signaling. These receptors converge on mTOR, AKT, and ERK pathways to promote tumor cell proliferation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling promoting anabolic metabolism and proliferation
- Sustained MAPK-ERK activation driving proliferation and survival
- Increased genomic instability through aberrant growth factor signaling
- Cross-talk between multiple growth factor pathways creating redundancy and therapeutic resistance

### Lin28-let-7 axis regulating stemness and differentiation
The Lin28-let-7 pathway is a conserved heterochronic regulatory axis that controls the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in stem cells and cancer. LIN28B is an RNA-binding protein that blocks biogenesis of the tumor-suppressive let-7 microRNA family by recruiting Terminal Uridylyl Transferase (ZCCHC11) that polyuridylates and marks pre-let-7 for degradation. By repressing let-7, LIN28B maintains expression of oncogenes including MYC, HMGA2, RAS, and pluripotency factors. This program is particularly relevant in GBM where stemness is associated with treatment resistance and recurrence.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced and sustained expression of oncogenic transcription factors (MYC, HMGA2)
- Maintenance of stemness and resistance to differentiation signals
- Increased chemotherapy and radiation resistance
- Promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype
- Enhanced tumor-initiating cell (TIC) properties

### Developmental transcriptional regulation and cell fate specification
GBM cells exhibit striking similarity to embryonic neural progenitor cells and recapitulate developmental gene regulatory networks. This program includes key developmental transcription factors (SOX6, EYA1) and regulatory complexes (EYA1-SIX1-BRG1 BAF) that specify cell fate during neural development. SOX6 is part of the SoxD family and promotes neural progenitor maintenance. EYA1 encodes a dual-function protein with both transcriptional activation and protein phosphatase activity; it interacts with SIX1 and chromatin remodeling complexes to specify sensory and neural cell fates. These factors enable developmental plasticity and undifferentiated phenotype in GBM cells.

**Predicted impacts:**
