## Program Summaries
### Ciliary Dysfunction and Motility Defects
Coordinated dysfunction of cilia and flagella structure and function through loss-of-function variants in axonemal dynein and associated proteins. In glioblastoma context, ciliary dysfunction may impair motile cilia-dependent signaling and cellular communication, particularly relevant given that mutations in CFAP43 and DNAH5 cause morphological abnormalities in motile cilia that result in hydrocephalus and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Multiple genes encoding dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs) and outer dynein arm components are present in this program.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Impaired primary cilia formation and motility may disrupt hedgehog signaling transduction and cellular sensing of microenvironmental cues
- Loss of ciliary-mediated fluid flow and mechanotransduction may compromise cell-cell communication within tumor microenvironment
- Defective cilia may alter intraflagellar transport and affect localization of signaling proteins involved in tumor progression
- Ciliary dysfunction may disrupt planar cell polarity signaling, potentially affecting collective glioma cell migration and invasion patterns

### IL-6-Mediated Immunosuppression
Coordinated immunosuppressive signaling driven by IL-6 axis and its regulation through NEGR1 and GABAergic receptor signaling. In glioblastoma, this program supports tumor growth through myeloid-cell polarization and T-cell exhaustion. IL6R activation drives STAT3-dependent immunosuppression, while NEGR1 negatively regulates IL-6 trans-signaling. GABAergic neurons provide depolarizing input to DMG cells through GABRA5-mediated signaling, promoting tumor growth.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced IL-6 signaling promotes M2 macrophage polarization and increases PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells, suppressing CD8+ T cell function
- Increased circulating IL-6 and sIL-6R create systemic immunosuppressive environment; elevated IL-6 correlates with worse overall survival
- GABAergic synaptic input depolarizes glioma cells through GABA-A receptor activation, promoting depolarization-dependent tumor growth in diffuse midline gliomas
- Combined IL-6-driven myeloid suppression and GABA-mediated glioma cell depolarization create robust immunosuppressive niche resistant to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy
- NEGR1-mediated negative regulation of IL-6 trans-signaling could serve as brake on immunosuppression but is likely downregulated in GBM

### Tumor-Suppressive Chromatin Remodeling
CHD5 and related chromatin remodeling factors mediate tumor suppression through histone binding and transcriptional regulation of cell cycle inhibitors and differentiation programs. CHD5 is a member of the chromatin remodeling complex family mapping to 1p36, a region frequently deleted in cancer. CHD5 binds unmodified histone H3 through its PHD domains and regulates expression of p16 and p19 tumor suppressors. Loss of CHD5 or its functional domains abrogates tumor suppression and promotes gliomagenesis.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Loss or functional impairment of CHD5 removes critical brake on glioma cell proliferation and blocks differentiation programs protective against transformation
- Intact CHD5 function maintains expression of p16 and p19 tumor suppressors, preventing aberrant cell cycle progression
- ZNF521 overexpression in SHH-pathway-driven gliomas promotes stemness maintenance and migration through enhanced Hedgehog signaling
- Combined CHD5 loss and ZNF521 upregulation would create permissive environment for glioma initiation and maintenance of stem cell properties

### Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Invasion
POSTN, THBS1, and collagen genes coordinate extracellular matrix remodeling to promote glioma cell invasion, angiogenesis, and immune suppression. POSTN secreted by glioma stem cells recruits tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promotes invasive phenotype through NF-κB signaling. THBS1 is upregulated with glioma grade and mediates both angiogenesis and invasion while contributing to immune suppression. Collagen genes define mesenchymal GBM subtype with prognostic implications.

**Predicted impacts:**
- POSTN-mediated TAM recruitment creates immunosuppressive microenvironment enriched in M2 macrophages expressing immunosuppressive cytokines and PD-L1
- POSTN-driven NF-κB activation in glioma cells enhances EMT, invasiveness, and chemoresistance
- THBS1 upregulation promotes both angiogenesis and invasion while simultaneously suppressing CD8+ T cell proliferation through TNF-β-mediated mechanisms

### Metabolic Reprogramming and Energy Homeostasis
KSR2, ADCY8, SLC22A3, and ion channel proteins coordinate metabolic reprogramming of glioma cells to enhance proliferation and chemoresistance. KSR2 integrates mitogenic and metabolic signaling through AMPK, regulating both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. ADCY8 polymorphisms correlate with glioma risk in sex-specific manner through cAMP pathway modulation. SLC22A3 functions as tumor suppressor through metabolic homeostasis. Ion channels including KCNJ3 and CACNA2D1 regulate cell volume, calcium signaling, and metabolic capacity.

### Neurotransmitter Signaling and Synaptic Communication
GRM1 and GRM4 metabotropic glutamate receptors mediate pro-tumor glutamatergic signaling that drives glioma proliferation and suppresses antitumor immunity. NRG3 neuregulin ligand activates ErbB4 receptors involved in glial differentiation and survival signaling. Dysregulation of these synaptic communication pathways enables glioma cells to integrate signals from surrounding neurons and facilitate tumor progression through glutamate-calcium signaling and neuregulin-ErbB crosstalk.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Elevated mGluR1/5 signaling in glioma cells activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR pro-survival axis and drives proliferation through positive feedback enhancement of glutamate release
- mGluR2/3 signaling suppresses G1/S transition in subset of GBM cells, potentially promoting quiescent glioma stem cell population resistant to cytotoxic therapy
- GRM4 upregulation in glioma creates immunosuppressive microenvironment by suppressing NK and T cell antitumor immunity through cAMP modulation
- NRG3-ErbB4 signaling enhances glial cell differentiation and survival while simultaneously promoting expression of neurotransmitter receptors that sensitize glioma cells to neuronal input
