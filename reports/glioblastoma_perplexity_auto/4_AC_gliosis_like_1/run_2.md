## Program Summaries
### Aquaporin-mediated osmotic water transport and migration
Water channel proteins (AQP1, AQP4) regulate osmotic gradients essential for glioma cell migration and edema formation. AQP4 localizes to leading edges of migrating cells and lamellipodia, facilitating volume changes during invasion through narrow extracellular spaces. Coordinated with ion transporters (KCNN3, ATP1A2, SLC14A1) that maintain ion gradients driving osmotic water flux. Dysregulation contributes to both tumor-associated vasogenic edema and enhanced invasive capability.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced directional cell migration through osmotic volume regulation
- Increased infiltration of tumor cells through brain parenchyma
- Promotion of vasogenic edema formation at tumor-brain interface
- Support for invasive cell membrane protrusions (lamellipodia formation)
- Maintenance of perivascular migration along blood vessel corridors

### Aerobic glycolysis-dependent nutrient acquisition
Glioblastomas exhibit constitutive aerobic glycolysis despite adequate oxygen (Warburg effect), characterized by upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters. PFKFB3 is the most highly expressed glycolytic regulator in GBM, controlling the rate-limiting step through F-2,6-BP production. This metabolic state is driven by hypoxic microenvironments and genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, PTEN loss). Elevated glycolysis supports both energy production and anabolic biosynthesis, driving tumor cell proliferation and survival. This program is inseparable from invasion, as perivascular glioma cells show peak glycolytic enzyme expression including AQP1, LDH, and cathepsin B.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced ATP production supporting tumor growth and proliferation
- Increased lactate and H+ secretion promoting acidic tumor microenvironment
- Support for anabolic pathways (nucleotide, lipid, amino acid synthesis)
- Hypoxia adaptation and maintenance of hypoxic metabolic state
- Coupling with angiogenic escape mechanisms to overcome anti-VEGF therapy

### Extracellular matrix remodeling and invasive phenotype
Glioma cells exhibit dynamic ECM remodeling through coordinated synthesis (HAS2, HAS3 driving hyaluronic acid accumulation) and degradation (ADAMTS8, TIMP3, matrix metalloproteinases). CD44 serves as the primary HA receptor, engaging osteopontin (OPN/SPP1) signaling to promote migration, invasion, and stemness. IGFBP7 promotes glioma cell migration through AKT-ERK pathway activation. Increased ECM deposition (particularly brevican/BCAN and other proteoglycans) creates a denser, more resistant tumor microenvironment. HAS2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and GBM subtype (IDH-WT, non-1p/19q codeletion). Loss of ADAMTS8 (an inhibitory protease) contributes to glioma progression.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion through remodeled ECM
- Increased stemness and self-renewal via CD44-osteopontin signaling
- Promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
- Increased resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy through altered ECM composition
- Support for perivascular migration and vascular co-option
- Enhanced mechanotransduction signaling through integrin-FAK pathways

### Complement system activation and immune modulation
The complement cascade is activated within gliomas through multiple pathways (classical via C1q, alternative, and lectin pathways via MASP1/MASP2/COLEC12). Complement components C3 and C5 generate potent anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) that promote M2 macrophage polarization and immunosuppression. C3a-C3aR signaling in glioma stem cells (GSCs) maintains stemness through STAT-3 and Wnt/SOX2 pathways. CD38 functions as an ectoenzyme converting NAD+ to immunosuppressive adenosine and ADPR. CHI3L2 (YKL40) is secreted by tumor and immune cells, promoting inflammatory responses and inducing CD8+ T cell apoptosis. This program collectively shifts the immune microenvironment toward M2/immunosuppressive phenotypes.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Polarization of infiltrating macrophages/microglia toward M2 (immunosuppressive) phenotype
- Maintenance of glioma stem cell phenotype through C3a-STAT3-SOX2 signaling
- Suppression of CD8+ T cell function and promotion of regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation

### Glioma stem cell self-renewal and maintenance
Glioma stem cells (GSCs) reside in perivascular and hypoxic niches where they maintain multipotency and self-renewal capacity. Endothelin-3 (EDN3) and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) autocrine signaling is essential for GSC maintenance; blocking EDNRB induces apoptosis and impairs tumor-sphere formation. HOPX marks radial progenitor-like cells in glioma. CD44 and osteopontin (OPN) signaling within the perivascular niche promotes stem cell phenotypes and tumor growth. Complement C3a signaling through C3aR maintains GSCs via STAT-3 and Wnt/SOX2 activation. IGFBP7 and growth factor signaling support GSC migration along blood vessels. ID3 and ID4 (inhibitors of differentiation) regulate GSC proliferation and maintain undifferentiated state.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Maintenance of undifferentiated GSC phenotype and multipotency
- Enhanced self-renewal capacity and tumor-sphere formation
- Increased resistance to differentiation-inducing signals
- Support for perivascular localization and niche interaction
- Enhanced survival signaling through multiple pathways (EDN, complement, CD44)

### Tumor-associated astrocyte and glial cell reprogramming
Peritumoral and tumor-resident astrocytes undergo reactive transformation (gliosis) characterized by GFAP upregulation. Tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) display distinct morphology and transcriptomic profiles depending on anatomical location (tumor core, periphery, perivascular niche, border). ALDH1L1 marks gliogenic precursors and mature astrocytes. TAAs enhance glioma cell viability and migration by upregulating CD44 expression in tumor cells through paracrine mechanisms. Reactive astrocytes modulate immune cell recruitment through purinergic signaling (ATP/adenosine metabolism, CD73). This program represents a critical stromal-tumor interaction that supports malignancy.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced glioma cell migration and viability through astrocyte-derived paracrine factors
- Upregulation of stemness-promoting genes (CD44) in adjacent tumor cells
- Promotion of M1 macrophage infiltration and immune cell recruitment
- Increased extracellular adenosine production creating immunosuppressive microenvironment

### Gap junction communication and chemoresistance
Connexin 43 (GJA1) forms gap junctions enabling intercellular communication but also confers chemoresistance to temozolomide (TMZ) and other chemotherapeutic agents. Cx43 is highly expressed in a subpopulation of GBM; Cx43 mRNA strongly correlates with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. Cx43 activates PI3K (specifically PIK3CB/p110β) signaling independent of its channel function (non-channel function). CD38 ectoenzyme activity may modulate adenosine levels affecting gap junction function. Combining Cx43 inhibition (αCT1 peptide) with PI3K inhibitors (TGX-221, GSK2636771) sensitizes GBM to TMZ.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced intercellular communication enabling collective tumor behavior
- Activation of PI3K/AKT survival signaling independent of chemotherapy
- Increased resistance to temozolomide and other chemotherapeutic agents
- Poor treatment response and shortened progression-free survival
- Maintenance of tumor cell viability despite DNA-damaging therapies

### Pericyte recruitment and vascular stability
Pericytes (mural cells) are recruited to glioma vasculature through PDGF-B/PDGFR-β signaling. Pericytes play paradoxical roles: structurally supporting vessel formation but also promoting treatment resistance. NG2 (a pericyte marker not in input list) isoforms in proliferative perivascular pericytes promote early angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry. PDGFRB signaling activates PI3K, promoting pericyte recruitment to hypoxic tumor regions. Two pericyte subtypes exist: Type-1 (non-contributing to new vessel formation; can differentiate to tumor-associated fibroblasts) and Type-2 (pro-angiogenic). Hypoxia induces HIF-1α-mediated PDGF-β expression in endothelial cells, recruiting pericytes. Anti-VEGF therapies lead to increased pericyte vessel coverage, promoting vascular stabilization and therapy resistance.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced tumor vascular network formation and stabilization
- Recruitment of pericytes to hypoxic tumor regions
- Support for glioma stem cell maintenance in perivascular niche
- Increased resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies (bevacizumab)
- Promotion of vascular invasion and infiltration
- Development of abnormal vascular patterns with atypical pericyte coverage

### Immune cell infiltration and M2 macrophage polarization
Multiple genes in this list promote M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization and creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. CHI3L2 (YKL40) is secreted by tumor cells and immune cells (particularly macrophages), promoting M2-like activation. COLEC12 (C-type lectin) functions as a scavenger receptor upregulated on M2 macrophages. ZFP36L2 correlates with immune infiltration and is positively associated with M2 macrophage markers. Complement components (C3, C3a) promote M2 polarization through C3aR signaling on macrophages. NMB (neuromedin B) expression correlates with immune infiltration and improved GBM survival. OSMR and other cytokine receptors on myeloid cells support immune cell recruitment and polarization.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Recruitment and infiltration of macrophages/microglia into tumor microenvironment
- Shift of macrophage phenotype from pro-inflammatory (M1) to immunosuppressive (M2) state
- Increased expression of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β)
- Enhanced T cell exhaustion and impaired anti-tumor immunity
- Support for tumor angiogenesis and invasive phenotype

### Metabolic reprogramming and hypoxia adaptation
Gliomas undergo profound metabolic rewiring to survive hypoxic microenvironments and aggressive selection pressures. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a master regulator activating genes for glycolysis, angiogenesis, and stemness. PFKFB3 is the most highly expressed glycolytic enzyme and undergoes post-translational modifications (O-GlcNAcylation, phosphorylation) in response to hypoxia. HAS2 and HAS3 (hyaluronic acid synthases) are upregulated under hypoxia and glycolytic conditions. Endothelin signaling (EDNRA/EDNRB) is hypoxia-responsive and promotes both metabolic adaptation and GSC stemness. This program bridges metabolic, signaling, and stemness programs, reflecting the integrated nature of GBM adaptation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Coordinated upregulation of glycolytic pathway under hypoxia
- Maintenance of tumor cell viability in oxygen-deprived regions
- Enhanced stemness signaling through hypoxia-responsive pathways
- Increased ECM synthesis supporting tumor architecture
- Metabolic adaptation supporting rapid proliferation and invasion
- Coupling of metabolic and stemness programs through HIF-1α and endothelin signaling
