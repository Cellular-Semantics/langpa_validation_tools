## Program Summaries
### Osmotic Cell Volume Regulation and Migration
Coordinated expression of aquaporins and ion transporters that regulate intracellular osmolarity, enabling rapid water flux and cell volume changes required for glioma cell migration through brain parenchyma. This program couples water channel activity (AQP1, AQP4, SLC14A1) with potassium and sodium channels (KCNN3, ATP1A2, SCN7A) to create osmotic gradients that drive lamellipodia formation and invasion through restricted extracellular spaces.

**Predicted impacts:**
