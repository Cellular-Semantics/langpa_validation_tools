## Program Summaries
### EMT-Driven Invasive Dispersal
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition program enabling glioblastoma cells to escape the tumor core and infiltrate adjacent brain tissue. SERPINE1 and EMP1 regulate cell adhesion dynamics and directional migration through extracellular matrix interactions. FOSL1 maintains mesenchymal transcriptional identity, while HMGA2 sustains glioma-initiating cell properties required for sustained invasion. COL5A1 and FN1 remodel the extracellular matrix to facilitate cell movement.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Tryptophan-Pathway Immune Evasion
Comprehensive immune suppression program centered on activation of the kynurenine pathway. IDO1 and TDO2 catalyze tryptophan degradation, producing immunosuppressive kynurenine metabolites that promote regulatory T cell expansion and cytotoxic T cell apoptosis. CHI3L1 (YKL-40) upregulates IDO1/TDO2 expression and coordinates with kynurenine to inhibit anti-tumor immunity. This program operates in coordination with IL-6 and IL-1β signaling to establish a profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment.

**Predicted impacts:**

### IL-6/IL-1β-NF-κB/STAT3 Signaling Axis
Central pro-inflammatory yet immunosuppressive signaling loop driven by IL-6 and IL-1β cytokines. TNF-α activation of NF-κB induces IL-6 expression, which in turn activates STAT3 signaling. This creates a self-reinforcing autocrine loop that drives tumor cell proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance while simultaneously establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment through recruitment of myeloid cells. TNFAIP2 and TNFAIP3 are downstream targets that modulate the intensity of this inflammatory response.

**Predicted impacts:**

### VEGFA-Driven Tumor Angiogenesis
Hypoxia-driven pro-angiogenic program centered on VEGFA expression and signaling. VEGFA stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, providing essential nutrient and oxygen supply to growing tumors. Cooperating factors including CXCL2, CXCL8, and ANGPTL4 enhance angiogenic responses. CAV1 (caveolin-1) regulates endothelial cell function in tumor vasculature. This program is essential for tumor growth beyond hypoxic diffusion limits and is associated with poor prognosis.

**Predicted impacts:**

### MET-Driven Stemness and Invasiveness
Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling centered on MET activation, a critical driver of glioma stem cell self-renewal, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. Recent evidence identifies a circular MET RNA (circMET) encoding MET404 variant that forms constitutively active receptor independent of ligand (HGF) stimulation. MET signaling promotes proliferation, survival, and migration while maintaining stem cell features. High MET404 expression predicts poor prognosis. This program is particularly important in primary GBMs with MET amplification or fusion events.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Apoptosis Evasion and Drug Resistance
Multi-layered anti-apoptotic program centered on Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) proteins BIRC3 and BAG3. BIRC3 (cIAP2) is uniquely prognostic of survival in GBM, with low expression associated with favorable outcomes and high expression correlating with shorter survival. BAG3 maintains HSP70-mediated suppression of BAX translocation to mitochondria, preventing apoptotic signaling. Both proteins are upregulated in response to standard therapy (temozolomide, radiation), contributing to therapeutic resistance. STAT3 and PI3K signaling pathways drive this therapy-induced resistance.

**Predicted impacts:**

- Reduced apoptosis following ionizing radiation therapy
- Sustained proliferation despite conventional therapeutic insults
- Treatment-induced enrichment of therapy-resistant GBM cell populations

### Innate Immune Pattern Recognition
Interferon-mediated innate immune response program centered on toll-like receptor signaling (TLR2) and interferon-stimulated gene expression. TLR2 expressed on glioma-associated microglia rapidly responds to tumor antigens and modulates inflammation-associated immune responses including phagocytosis. TLR2-MHC I axis on microglia contributes to CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation. GBP family proteins (GBP2, GBP5) are downstream effectors of interferon signaling involved in pathogen defense and tumor immunity. MX2 is interferon-induced antiviral protein with emerging roles in tumor immunogenicity.

**Predicted impacts:**

Six collagen genes (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL4A2, COL5A2) collectively regulate immune infiltration and EMT processes. Collagen expression correlates positively with stromal and immune scores but creates immunosuppressive phenotype. SPP1 (osteopontin) participates in ECM remodeling and tumor progression.

### Stemness Maintenance and Self-Renewal
Multi-component program sustaining glioma stem cell (GSC) properties including self-renewal, differentiation capacity, and tumorigenicity. HMGA2 is central transcriptional modulator maintaining GSC propagation and clonogenicity. ANGPTL4 promotes stemness enrichment through EGFR/AKT/4E-BP1 cascade, particularly in temozolomide-resistant populations. PROM1 (CD133) serves as GSC marker. This program is essential for tumor initiation, recurrence following therapy, and resistance to conventional treatments.
