## Program Summaries
### Extracellular Matrix Remodeling
This program comprises genes encoding secreted proteins and proteases that modify the glioblastoma microenvironment. The program includes collagen deposition, proteoglycan synthesis, and matrix metalloproteinase regulation. In GBM, dysregulation of this program promotes invasive phenotype, particularly in hypoxic and bevacizumab-resistant tumors. Collagen VI (COL6A3) and collagen III (COL3A1) accumulation stiffens the tumor microenvironment, enhancing β-catenin signaling and mesenchymal marker expression. Periostin (POSTN) expression correlates with glioma grade and poor prognosis. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (NDST4/HS3ST2) regulate growth factor binding and cell migration. Fibulin-like proteins (FSTL4, FSTL5) promote matrix scaffold formation. Matrix metalloproteinase regulation through FAP and ADAMTS3 enables invasion through brain tissue.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Increased tumor stiffness promoting mechanotransduction and β-catenin signaling
- Enhanced migration and invasion through brain tissue via matrix degradation
- Reduced response to anti-angiogenic therapy through altered matrix composition
- Support for tumor-associated immune cell infiltration and M2 macrophage recruitment
- Maintenance of hypoxic microenvironment through altered matrix density

### Cadherin-Mediated Cell Adhesion
This program encompasses classical cadherins and associated adherens junction proteins that mediate homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion. In GBM, cadherin expression undergoes dynamic changes that facilitate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). E-cadherin (CDH1, not in input) is downregulated in high-grade gliomas through promoter methylation, particularly in microvascular proliferation regions. N-cadherin (not in input) undergoes proteolytic cleavage by ADAM10 at significantly higher rates in GBM than normal brain, with cleavage facilitating migration. The program includes multiple classical cadherins (CDH4, CDH9, CDH13, CDH18) with distinct adhesion patterns and downstream signaling. NEDD4L ubiquitinates Dishevelled proteins to negatively regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a pathway that promotes GBM proliferation and stemness. Cadherin switching and shedding are hallmarks of GBM invasive phenotype.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Loss of epithelial adhesion properties and gain of mesenchymal phenotype
- Enhanced cell motility through cadherin shedding and membrane redistribution
- Increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling promoting proliferation and stemness maintenance
- Altered actin cytoskeleton dynamics facilitating 3D invasion
- Heterotypic adhesion with stromal cells promoting local invasion

### Calcium Signaling Through Ion Channels
This program comprises genes encoding ion channels and calcium-dependent signaling molecules that regulate intracellular calcium concentrations and downstream effectors. Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels including TRPM3, TRPM7, TRPM8, and TRPC5 are dysregulated in glioma cells and drive proliferation, migration, and invasion. TRPC1 channels are essential for chemotactic migration in response to EGF and PDGF through lipid raft-dependent mechanisms. TRPC6 is upregulated in hypoxic GBM cells via Notch signaling and promotes proliferation through calcineurin-NFAT pathway activation. TRPM7 suppression significantly inhibits GBM cell growth and invasion through miR-28-5p-mediated pathways and JAK2/STAT3 signaling. TRPM8 expression correlates with GBM aggressiveness and poor survival. Voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNJ6, KCNC2) maintain resting membrane potential. Anoctamins (ANO4) are calcium-activated chloride channels affecting calcium compartmentalization. Phosphodiesterases (PDE1A, PDE1C) regulate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and cAMP signaling affecting cell motility. GABBR2 (GABA B receptor) modulates inhibitory neurotransmitter signaling affecting network-level GBM behavior.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Increased intracellular calcium promoting proliferation through calcineurin-NFAT pathway
- Enhanced migratory capacity through TRPC-mediated lipid raft signaling
- Altered response to growth factors (EGF, PDGF) through TRP-mediated chemotaxis

### Synaptic Development and Adhesion
This program comprises genes encoding synaptic adhesion molecules, calcium sensors for neurotransmitter release, and axon guidance cues. The program includes contactin-associated protein-like molecules (CNTNAP4, CNTNAP5), contactins (CNTN5), teneurins (TENM2), synaptotagmins (SYT1), and semaphorins (SEMA3C). TENM2 forms nanoclusters at presynaptic active zones and is essential for synaptic connectivity, particularly in hippocampal projections. SYT1 serves as the primary calcium sensor for fast neurotransmitter release and is involved in vesicle recycling. Contactins mediate cell-cell adhesion at synaptic cleft. CNTNAP4 regulates synaptic development and maturation. Semaphorins (SEMA3C) act as axon guidance cues affecting neurite outgrowth and axonal pathfinding. In GBM context, this program may be dysregulated to suppress pro-differentiation signaling or alternatively utilized to support GBM cell-cell interactions and network formation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Altered synaptic connectivity potentially suppressing pro-differentiation signals

### Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling
This program comprises genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their signaling intermediates that drive proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and migration in GBM. The program includes FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor), KIT (c-KIT/stem cell factor receptor), and GFRA1 (GDNF co-receptor). RTKs activate downstream MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways controlling cell cycle progression and survival. FGFR2 mutations and amplifications are detected in GBM; FGFR signaling promotes both proliferation and mesenchymal differentiation. KIT is normally expressed during CNS development in endothelial and mast cell progenitors; KIT overexpression in GBM promotes angiogenesis and contributes to tumor growth. GFRA1 is the co-receptor for GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), which promotes neuron survival and differentiation; deletion of GFRA1 and nearby genes may contribute to GBM pathogenesis. RTK signaling is also modulated by N-cadherin complexes (CDH2 not in input) that decrease FGFR1 internalization sustaining proliferation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced proliferation through sustained MAPK/ERK pathway activation
- Improved survival through PI3K/Akt anti-apoptotic signaling

### Transcriptional Repression of Neural Differentiation
This program comprises transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins that regulate neuronal differentiation, splicing, and transcriptional networks. The program includes MYT1L (myelin transcription factor 1-like), EBF1/EBF2 (early B-cell factors), RBFOX1 (RNA-binding fox-1), CUX2 (cut-like homeobox 2), SRRM4 (serine/arginine repetitive matrix 4), POU6F2, and RUNX1T1. MYT1L directly represses YAP1 expression, reducing GBM cell proliferation and promoting neural differentiation; MYT1L expression inversely correlates with YAP1 expression in GBM. Reduced MYT1L expression associates with GBM progression and poor survival. EBF factors regulate cortical neuron development and are downregulated in GBM. RBFOX1 regulates both splicing and transcriptional networks important for neuronal development; RBFOX1 is implicated in autism and developmental delay with relevance to neural cell fate determination. CUX2 is expressed in cortical development and marks mature neuronal populations. SRRM4 promotes neuronal splicing programs. RUNX1T1 negatively influences transcription through HDAC recruitment. In GBM, suppression of this differentiation program maintains proliferative capacity and stemness.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Suppression of neural differentiation through MYT1L inactivation
- Maintenance of proliferative capacity through YAP1-mediated signaling
- Altered splicing of synaptic and adhesion proteins favoring undifferentiated state
- Loss of early differentiation signals through reduced EBF activity
- Enhanced stemness and self-renewal through suppressed differentiation programs

### Neuropeptide and Neurosecretion Pathways
This program comprises genes encoding secreted neuropeptides, hormones, and components of the secretory pathway that package and release bioactive peptides. The program includes SCG2 (secretogranin II), GCG (glucagon), CCK (cholecystokinin), and secretory pathway components including SLC38A11 (amino acid transporter for vesicle loading). SCG2 is a chromogranin/secretogranin family member processed into bioactive peptides EM66 and secretoneurin. SCG2 promotes neuronal differentiation and survival by counteracting nitric oxide-induced toxicity. SCG2 is regulated by REST (repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor) in neural progenitors with non-cell-autonomous differentiation-enhancing activity. SCG2-derived secretoneurin has angiogenic activity and modulates leukocyte transendothelial migration. In reduced SCG2 expression, tumor angiogenesis and aggressive behavior increase. GCG encodes proglucagon processed to GLP-1 and other peptides; GLP-1 neurons show emerging roles in metabolic and stress regulation. CCK encodes cholecystokinin processed to active peptides. In GBM, dysregulation of this program may alter neuroendocrine differentiation capacity and support tumor immune modulation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced neuronal differentiation through SCG2-mediated non-cell-autonomous signaling
- Increased angiogenesis through secretoneurin-mediated endothelial signaling
- Altered immune cell infiltration through leukocyte migration modulation
- Reduced tumor aggressiveness in conditions of high SCG2 expression
- Potential neuroendocrine differentiation capacity affecting GBM heterogeneity

### Cyclic Nucleotide Signaling and Cell Motility
This program comprises genes regulating cyclic nucleotide metabolism, calcium signaling coupling, and cell motility through cAMP/cGMP and calcium-dependent pathways. The program includes phosphodiesterases (PDE1A, PDE1C), adrenergic receptors (ADRA1B), and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) components. PDE1A and PDE1C are calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterases with dual specificity for cAMP and cGMP. PDE1C selectively regulates cAMP during SOCE, affecting leading-edge protrusions (LEP) formation critical for cell migration. Inhibition of PDE1C reduces SOCE-dependent ADCY8 activation, decreasing cAMP accumulation and LEP formation. PDE1C couples calcium signals to cAMP dynamics in spatially restricted signalosomes. ADRA1B (α1B-adrenergic receptor) is a G protein-coupled receptor activating PKC and influencing neuronal differentiation and cell migration. In GBM, dysregulation of this program alters cell motility and invasive phenotype.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Altered leading-edge protrusion dynamics affecting cell migration speed and direction
- Dysregulated cAMP signaling affecting cell motility and proliferation
- Enhanced SOCE-dependent signaling promoting calcium-driven invasion
- Modified adrenergic receptor signaling affecting neuronal differentiation capacity

### RNA-Binding and Post-Transcriptional Control
This program comprises RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression affecting mRNA stability, localization, and translation. The program includes RBFOX1 (RNA-binding fox-1), SRRM4 (serine/arginine repetitive matrix 4), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). RBFOX1 binds to GCAUG motifs in nascent RNA during splicing and also in 3' UTRs affecting mRNA stability and translation. Cytoplasmic RBFOX1 increases target mRNA stability and translation; cytoplasmic RBFOX1 targets are enriched in cortical development and autism-related genes. RBFOX1 knockout mice show altered synaptic transmission, increased membrane excitability, and seizure predisposition. Reduced RBFOX1 expression correlates with autism and developmental delay. SRRM4 is a neuron-specific splicing regulator. Multiple lncRNAs in the input list (LINC01033, LINC01344, LINC02607, LINC01949, LINC00862, LINC02378, LINC00470, LINC00707, LINC01965) may function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or direct regulators of gene expression. In GBM, dysregulation of RNA-binding protein networks could suppress neuronal differentiation programs.

**Predicted impacts:**
