## Program Summaries
### Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Myelination
A developmental gene program where GBM cells in white matter recapitulate oligodendrocyte differentiation pathways through SOX10-MYRF-mediated transcriptional cascades, leading to upregulation of myelin proteins (PLP1, MBP, MAG, MOG) and lipid synthesis enzymes (UGT8, FA2H). This program drives tumor cells toward pre-oligodendrocyte phenotypes with reduced proliferation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Tumor cell differentiation to pre-oligodendrocyte state with reduced proliferation
- Enhanced myelin protein production and membrane expansion
- Increased dependence on white matter injury signals for sustained differentiation
- Suppression of stemness and invasive capacity through maturation programs

### White Matter Invasion and Demyelination Response
GBM cells infiltrate white matter tracts, causing myelin disruption and triggering a glial injury response characterized by OPC activation, astrocyte reactivity, and microglia activation. This program couples tumor infiltration with pathological demyelination, creating paradoxical tumor suppression through endogenous repair mechanisms.

**Predicted impacts:**

### GPR17-Mediated OPC Arrest and Tumor Suppression
GPR17 functions as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, maintaining OPC in undifferentiated state. In GBM, however, GPR17 is overexpressed and paradoxically promotes tumor progression through enhanced cellular motility, proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This creates a context-dependent functional switch.

**Predicted impacts:**
