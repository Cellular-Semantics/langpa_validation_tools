## Program Summaries
### Calcium-mediated cell migration
Transient receptor potential (TRP) and ryanodine receptor channels regulate calcium influx and signaling cascades that control glioblastoma cell migration, invasion, and chemotaxis. Multiple TRP channels (TRPM8, TRPV4, TRPM3) and ryanodine receptors (RYR2, RYR3) work in concert with potassium channels to modulate intracellular calcium levels, activate kinases like CaMKII, and regulate cytoskeletal dynamics through BK channel-dependent pathways. This calcium signaling promotes volume changes necessary for lamellipodium extension and cell migration, and radiation-induced calcium signaling through TRPM8 confers radioresistance.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced cell migration and chemotaxis through calcium-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization
- Increased radioresistance via radiation-induced TRPM8 upregulation and impaired DNA repair
- Promotion of cell cycle progression through calcium-dependent kinase activation
- Facilitated transmigration through extracellular matrix barriers

### Extracellular matrix degradation and invasion
ADAMTS metalloproteinases, along with regulatory factors including periostin, reelin, and collagens, control extracellular matrix architecture and remodeling. ADAMTS3, ADAMTS14, and ADAMTS18 proteolytically cleave ECM components including aggrecan and versican, generating bioactive matrikines that promote tumor cell motility and invasion. Periostin (POSTN) interacts with integrins to promote invasion and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. In contrast, reelin acts as a natural inhibitor of glioma cell migration and invasion by disrupting integrin-matrix interactions. This program is critical for infiltrative behavior characteristic of GBM.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Degradation of basement membrane and perivascular ECM enabling infiltration of brain parenchyma
- Generation of pro-invasive matrikines from cleaved ECM components
- Enhanced integrin-mediated signaling promoting EMT and migration
- Resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy through POSTN-mediated pathway activation
- Countervailing anti-invasive effects from reelin that limit infiltration

### Cell adhesion and synaptic protein scaffolding
Protocadherin and cadherin family proteins (PCDH7, PCDH11X, PCDH11Y, CDH13, CDH18), along with synaptic adhesion molecules (NLGN4X, CNTNAP2, SYT1, SYN3), organize cellular junctions and synaptic contacts. These proteins regulate intercellular adhesion, cell migration, proliferation, and survival through calcium-dependent signaling and interactions with the actin cytoskeleton. CNTNAP2 functions in neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine stability, and synaptic transmission, while NLGN4X serves as a glioma-associated tumor antigen. Dysregulation of adhesion molecules contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and glioma stem cell (GSC) maintenance.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Altered cell-cell adhesion affecting glioma cell migration and invasiveness
- Enhanced synaptic integration with neuronal circuits driving proliferation
- Dysregulation of EMT programs through altered cadherin function

### Tumor-associated macrophage polarization and immune suppression
Scavenger receptors (CD163/MSR1, OLR1/LOX-1) and pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, LY96/MD2) direct monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) toward pro-tumoral M2-like phenotypes in the GBM microenvironment. CD163+ macrophages and M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) accumulate in perivascular and peritumoral regions, expressing immunosuppressive genes including complement inhibitors and producing pro-tumoral cytokines. LY96 associates with TLR4 activation of NF-κB pathway promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and TAM recruitment. MSR1/CD204 expression marks M2 macrophages and contributes to immunosuppression. CD96 and VSIG4 provide inhibitory signals to T cells, while other immune modifiers limit anti-tumor immunity.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Accumulation of pro-tumoral M2-like macrophages in GBM microenvironment
- Enhanced TLR4 signaling promoting MDM recruitment and inflammatory responses
- Suppression of CD8+ T cell proliferation and anti-tumor immunity
- Production of immunosuppressive cytokines and complement inhibitors by TAMs
- Poor response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to macrophage-mediated immune suppression
- Perivascular and peritumoral niche establishment promoting GSC maintenance

### Wnt/β-catenin pathway and stemness maintenance
PLD1, WNT16, KLF5, and associated signaling components regulate canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway that maintains glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and pluripotency. PLD1 promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling through phospholipase D activity and cross-talk with PI3K/Akt pathway, affecting GSC stemness and chemoresistance. KLF5 transcription factor functions downstream in GSC maintenance. STAT4 and MEOX2 provide additional transcriptional regulation. This pathway is essential for GSC maintenance, resistance to temozolomide (TMZ), and intrinsic tumorigenicity distinct from proliferating tumor core.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced GSC self-renewal and undifferentiated state maintenance
- Increased resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy
- Promotion of tumor initiation and heterogeneity
- Activation of pluripotency programs and multi-lineage differentiation potential
- Cross-talk with other stemness pathways (Notch, Hedgehog, BMP)

### Cholinergic immune modulation
CHRNA7 (alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and downstream signaling mediate anti-inflammatory effects through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). Activation of α7nAChR on macrophages and other immune cells suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) via JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB inhibition. This pathway provides immune regulatory function that may be co-opted by GBM to establish immunosuppressive microenvironment. CHRNA7 signaling represents intersection of neuronal and immune function relevant to glioma-neural circuit interactions.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages and microglia
- Modulation of microglia polarization from M1 to less inflammatory states
- Reduced infiltration of inflammatory immune cells into tumor
- Establishment of immunotolerant microenvironment favoring tumor growth
- Neuronal-immune cell coupling promoting tumor-supportive cross-talk

### DOCK protein-mediated immune synapse formation
DOCK2 and DOCK8 proteins function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho GTPases (CDC42, RAC1, RHO) controlling cytoskeleton dynamics and immune cell function. DOCK8 is particularly critical for T cell, B cell, and NK cell function through regulation of immune synapse formation, lymphocyte migration, and survival. DOCK proteins connect T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to actin cytoskeleton reorganization through WASP pathway. Loss of DOCK function impairs immune surveillance and increases cancer susceptibility. DOCK5 provides additional GEF function in cellular contexts.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Impaired T cell immune synapse formation reducing anti-tumor T cell killing
- Decreased lymphocyte migration into tumor reducing immune infiltration
- Reduced B cell function and antibody production affecting tumor surveillance
- Impaired NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity
- Compromised antigen presentation and immune activation

### Long non-coding RNA regulation of GBM processes
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from the LINC family, including LINC-PINT, MIR222HG, RMST, and numerous other LINC species, function as regulatory nodes controlling invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness, and therapeutic resistance. LINC-PINT suppresses cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT by blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling. LINC species show dysregulation in GBM tumors compared to normal brain and associate with aggressive phenotypes. These lncRNAs regulate EMT-related genes (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug), interact with miRNAs, and coordinate signaling pathway activation.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasive capacity when lncRNAs are upregulated
- Suppression of Wnt/β-catenin stemness pathway and cancer stem cell self-renewal
- Modulation of miRNA availability and post-transcriptional gene regulation
- Alteration of chromatin states affecting gene expression programs
- Potential therapeutic targets through lncRNA modulation

### Neuron-glioma synaptic plasticity
Glioblastoma cells form functional synapses with neurons through BDNF-TrkB signaling and other activity-dependent mechanisms. NLGN4X, CNTNAP2, SYT1, and SYN3 are core synaptic proteins mediating these interactions. BDNF secretion from neurons in response to activity increases glutamate-evoked currents in glioma cells through AMPA receptor trafficking, promoting tumor proliferation and progression. Glioma cells integrate into neural circuits at cancer-neuron interface, with activity-dependent synaptic plasticity regulating tumor behavior. This malignant plasticity represents cooption of normal adaptive mechanisms by tumor.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Integration of glioma cells into functional neural circuits
- Activity-dependent enhancement of glioma proliferation and migration
- Increased glutamate-evoked depolarization promoting tumor progression
- Glioma-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and glioma-associated epilepsy
- Coordinated glioma-neuron network activity propagating through tumor microtubes via gap junctions

### Scavenger receptor and pattern recognition signaling
Scavenger receptors (OLR1/LOX-1, MSR1/CD204, CD163) and pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, LY96/MD2) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and oxidized ligands, activating NF-κB and inflammatory pathways. OLR1 upregulation in cancer cells promotes NF-κB activation leading to suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of proliferation. LY96 associates with TLR4, and TLR2 activates innate immunity. These receptors shape macrophage phenotype and promote pro-tumoral inflammation. In GBM context, scavenger receptor signaling establishes immunosuppressive microenvironment and promotes intrinsic tumor cell growth.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Sustained NF-κB signaling promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis
- Pro-inflammatory cytokine production supporting tumor growth
- Macrophage polarization toward pro-tumoral M2 phenotype
- Enhanced migration and invasive capacity through NF-κB-dependent mechanisms
- Resistance to cell death and therapy
