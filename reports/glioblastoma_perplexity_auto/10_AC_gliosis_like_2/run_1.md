## Program Summaries
### Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Invasion
Gene program coordinating degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix to promote glioblastoma cell invasion and migration through brain tissue. This program includes collagen deposition, matrix metalloproteinase regulation, and integrin-mediated adhesion dynamics that facilitate the invasive phenotype characteristic of GBM mesenchymal subtypes. The program is particularly enriched in the tumor center where invasive mesenchymal-like cells drive aggressive progression.

**Predicted impacts:**

### RTK/MAPK Signaling Inhibition and Feedback
Gene program regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling cascades through negative feedback loops and pathway suppression mechanisms. The SPRY family genes encode classical negative feedback inhibitors of MAPK signaling downstream of growth factor receptors (EGFR, PDGFRA, FGFR). This program is dysregulated in GBM where SPRY expression is often reduced, allowing unopposed RTK signaling that drives proliferation and EMT. RGS proteins provide additional negative feedback on G-protein coupled receptor signaling.

**Predicted impacts:**

- SPRY2 as regulator of RTK signaling is essential for GBM cell proliferation and tumorigenicity; hyperactivation consequent to ERK signaling dysregulation.

### Wnt/β-catenin Pathway Activation
Gene program governing canonical Wnt signaling through LEF1 and associated transcriptional regulation. Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes stemness, migration, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance in glioblastoma. In GBM, this pathway is often overactive particularly in mesenchymal subtypes, allowing cells to recapitulate embryonic developmental programs that result in characteristic proliferation and invasiveness.

GDF15 is induced by radiation and drives VEGFA expression through MAPK/SP1 pathway in glioblastoma cells. High degree of tumor vascularization through increased VEGF production is a hallmark of GBM progression. Carbonic anhydrases (CA2, CA10) support hypoxia-driven angiogenesis through metabolic regulation.

**Predicted impacts:**

This program includes transcription factors (TFCP2L1, BNC2, EGR1, SOX1-OT) that coordinate expression of stemness markers and suppress differentiation. EGR1 orchestrates a PDGFA-dependent growth-stimulatory loop and activates genes (SHH, GLI1, NANOG) critical for GSC maintenance. The program is dysregulated in GBM to maintain tumor-initiating capacity and therapy resistance.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Hypoxia Response and Metabolic Adaptation
Gene program coordinating cellular responses to hypoxia and metabolic adaptation in the tumor microenvironment. Carbonic anhydrases (CA2, CA10) buffer pH changes and support glycolytic metabolism under hypoxia. SLC4A4 regulates sodium-bicarbonate transport supporting metabolic homeostasis. This program is activated in response to the hypoxic microenvironment characteristic of GBM tumors, where HIF1α and HIF2α upregulate angiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF, angiopoietins) and shift metabolism toward glycolysis.
