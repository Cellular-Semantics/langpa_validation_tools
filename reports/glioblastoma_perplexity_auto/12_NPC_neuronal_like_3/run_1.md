## Program Summaries
### Terminal Neuronal Differentiation Blockade
This program encompasses transcriptional and post-transcriptional factors that normally drive neuronal terminal differentiation and maturation. In GBM, systematic loss or repression of these factors prevents transition from progenitor to mature neuronal phenotype, enabling continued proliferation. Key transcription factors (EBF3, EBF1, MYT1L, RBFOX3) and post-transcriptional regulators (CELF4, SRRM4, RBFOX1) coordinate alternative splicing and translation of neuronal genes. Loss of these programs is particularly notable as EBF3 is inactivated through deletion or hypermethylation in 50-90% of high-grade gliomas.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Maintenance of proliferative capacity through suppression of terminal differentiation programs
- Retention of neural progenitor-like gene expression patterns enabling continued cell cycle entry
- Loss of synaptic maturation markers and structural specialization
- Reduced expression of differentiation-dependent apoptotic pathways
- Enhanced capacity for migration and invasion relative to differentiated neurons

### GABAergic Synaptic Tumor Promotion
This program represents a unique tumor-promoting mechanism where GABAergic neurons form functional synapses with GBM cells, particularly in diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) with H3K27M mutation. GABAergic input through GABA-A receptors produces depolarizing rather than hyperpolarizing currents in GBM cells due to elevated intracellular chloride maintained by NKCC1 transporter. This unusual depolarizing GABA signaling drives tumor cell proliferation and survival. The program includes synaptic vesicle proteins, neurotransmitter transporters, GABA receptors, and the chloride transporter NKCC1 that enables the depolarizing phenotype.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Increased intracellular calcium flux through depolarization-activated voltage-gated calcium channels
- Activation of calcium-dependent growth and survival signaling pathways
- Enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis in response to GABAergic input
- Increased tumor growth in regions with high GABAergic neuron density
- GABA-A antagonists (e.g., lorazepam) reduce DMG tumor growth and proliferation
- Depolarizing GABA distinguishes H3K27M-DMG from hemispheric high-grade gliomas lacking NKCC1 depolarizing function

### Axon Guidance & Cell Adhesion Dysregulation
This program encompasses the classical axon guidance molecules and cell adhesion molecules that normally establish correct neuronal connectivity and cell-cell contacts during brain development. These genes regulate repulsive and attractive interactions between neurons and guide axonal pathfinding. In GBM, altered expression of these molecules disrupts normal adhesive properties and enables aberrant cell migration and invasion. Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands regulate bidirectional signaling that sculpts developing axons and dendrites. Robo receptors bind Slit ligands to mediate repulsive guidance. Cadherins maintain homophilic cell-cell adhesion. In GBM, loss or alteration of adhesion molecules enables enhanced motility and invasion through tissue.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Reduced adhesion between glioma cells enabling dissociation and migration
- Altered axon-like cellular processes affecting glioma cell morphology and directionality
- Increased invasiveness through suppressed cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion mechanisms
- Dysregulated responses to repulsive guidance cues that normally confine cells
- Enhanced motility through disrupted cadherin-based contact inhibition

### Vascular Growth Factor Signaling & Angiogenesis
This program encompasses receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands that promote angiogenesis and vascular growth. NRP1 (neuropilin-1) is a VEGF co-receptor that enhances VEGF-165 binding to VEGFR2, amplifying angiogenic signaling. FGFR2 mediates fibroblast growth factor signaling important for vascular development. ERBB4 activation in GBM is associated with shorter survival and promotes tumor growth through ERK activation. KITLG (kit ligand) signals through KIT receptor on hematopoietic and vascular cells. These growth factor pathways drive robust angiogenesis supporting tumor vascularization and nutrient delivery.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced VEGF-dependent endothelial cell recruitment and angiogenesis
- Amplified angiogenic signaling through NRP1 co-receptivity with VEGFR2

### Ion Channel & Electrolyte Homeostasis Dysregulation
This program encompasses ion channels and transporters that maintain cellular electrolyte balance and control neuronal excitability. Potassium channels (KCNQ3, KCNK2, KCNH8) regulate resting membrane potential and electrical activity. Voltage-gated calcium channels, modulated by CACNA2D3 auxiliary subunit, control calcium influx. CACNA2D3 functions as a tumor suppressor and is downregulated in gliomas. The bicarbonate transporter SLC4A10 participates in pH homeostasis. In GBM, dysregulation of these ion channels and transporters contributes to altered electrolyte balance that supports tumor cell survival and potentially creates a depolarized state permissive for abnormal signaling.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Altered resting membrane potential affecting cellular signaling thresholds
- Dysregulated calcium homeostasis affecting metabolic and signaling processes
- Loss of tumor suppressive effects of CACNA2D3 enabling continued proliferation
- Altered pH homeostasis supporting metabolic reprogramming

### Synaptic Plasticity & Dendritic Maturation
This program encompasses genes that control the formation, maturation, and plasticity of synaptic connections. Synaptotagmin proteins (SYT1, SYT4) are calcium sensors in presynaptic vesicles that trigger neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic density proteins and related factors organize the postsynaptic compartment. CELF4, a translational repressor of synaptic proteins, is critical for prenatal synaptic development. Dendritic spine formation and maintenance depend on polarity proteins that compartmentalize spine structure. Aberrant expression of these genes in GBM disrupts synaptic specialization while potentially enhancing migratory and invasive phenotypes.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Loss of synaptic specialization reducing differentiated phenotype
- Decreased compartmentalization of dendritic spines affecting cell morphology
- Reduced postsynaptic organization and functional synaptic connectivity
- Enhanced cellular plasticity enabling migration and invasion
- Altered calcium signaling at synapses affecting neuronal communication
- Shift from post-mitotic synaptic functions toward proliferative phenotype

**Supporting genes:** CELF4, SYT1, SYT4, SV2B, SYNPR, INSYN2B, NSG2, NYAP2, LAMP5, NRSN1, GRIP2

### Axonal Maintenance & Cytoskeletal Integrity
This program encompasses genes that maintain axonal structure, diameter, and conduction velocity through organization of neurofilaments and microtubules. STMN2 (stathmin-2) is critical for establishing and maintaining neurofilament-dependent axoplasmic organization. Loss of STMN2 leads to shrinkage of neurofilament spacing, axonal collapse, and motor and sensory deficits. SV2B regulates presynaptic calcium and synaptic vesicle dynamics affecting axonal function. Dynein motors (DYNC1I1) transport cargo along microtubules. In GBM, dysregulation of axonal maintenance genes may contribute to aberrant cell morphology and altered cellular dynamics.

**Predicted impacts:**

### Apoptosis Resistance & Cell Survival Pathways
This program encompasses genes controlling cell death and survival decisions. HRK (Harakiri) is a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein of the Bcl-2 family that regulates apoptosis by interfering with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. DACH1 and DACH2 are tumor suppressors that activate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis genes while repressing survival and proliferation genes. TP73 encodes p73, a p53-related transcription factor with complex roles in apoptosis and stemness. Loss or downregulation of these pro-death and pro-differentiation factors enables GBM cells to resist apoptosis and maintain viability despite stress.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Reduced susceptibility to intrinsic apoptotic triggers through loss of pro-apoptotic signaling
- Enhanced cell survival signaling through loss of death-promoting transcription factors

### Retinoic Acid & MAPK-CaMKII Signaling Integration
This program encompasses genes mediating non-canonical retinoic acid (RA) signaling through cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1). CRABP1 acts as a signalosome that integrates retinoic acid with MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and CaMKII (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) signaling. CRABP1 suppresses MAPK-dependent cell proliferation by competing with Ras for interaction with RAF kinase, dampening ERK activation. CRABP1 also dampens CaMKII over-activation that could trigger neuronal death. This integrated signaling pathway affects stem cell proliferation, cancer progression, and neuronal survival.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced MAPK-dependent proliferation through loss of CRABP1-mediated signal dampening
- Increased growth factor responsiveness and proliferative signaling
- Reduced retinoic acid-mediated differentiation and growth suppression

### Metabolic Reprogramming & Warburg Effect Activation
This program encompasses genes involved in metabolic reconfiguration toward aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) that characterizes GBM. Protein kinase C (PRKCA) signaling promotes metabolic reprogramming through MAPK pathway activation. Glycosyltransferases and metabolic enzymes (ST6GAL1, PCSK2, ADCY8, HSD11B2, PIP5K1B) support altered glucose, lipid, and nucleotide metabolism. The Warburg effect—preference for glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation even under normoxia—supports GBM proliferation and contributes to therapy resistance. Hypoxia and metabolic stress activate transcription factors (HIF-1alpha) that drive expression of glycolytic genes.

**Predicted impacts:**
- Enhanced glucose uptake and glycolytic flux supporting rapid ATP generation
- Increased lactate production and acidic microenvironment
- Resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy through metabolic support of tumor survival
- Enhanced lipid and nucleotide synthesis supporting rapid cell division

### Extracellular Matrix Remodeling & Cell Migration
This program encompasses genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and enzymes that modify ECM structure, enabling GBM cell migration and invasion. Matrix stiffening through deposition of structural proteins (FRAS1, HMCN1, SPOCK1, SVEP1) and glycosaminoglycan modifications (B3GAT2, B3GLCT, NDST4, HS3ST5) promotes glioma cell invasiveness. ECM stiffness activates mechanotransduction pathways that condition glioma cells for enhanced invasion. Sialyltransferases (ST6GAL1) and other glycosyltransferases modify cell surface glycoproteins affecting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Hyaluronidases (CEMIP2) degrade hyaluronic acid facilitating cell migration.

**Predicted impacts:**

### G-Protein-Coupled Receptor & Neuroendocrine Signaling
This program encompasses G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and associated signaling that drive glioma cell proliferation and survival. SSTR2 (somatostatin receptor 2) is a GPCR highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors but expression can be downregulated. Recent studies show that SSTR2 interacts with Wnt pathway protein Dvl1 in a ligand-independent manner, targeting SSTR2 for lysosomal degradation. GRK5 (G-protein receptor kinase 5) phosphorylates GPCRs affecting their signaling output and internalization. Adenylyl cyclase (ADCY8) produces cAMP, a key second messenger in GPCR signaling. These pathways affect proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism in GBM.

**Predicted impacts:**
