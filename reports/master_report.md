# DeepSearch Consistency and GO Coverage Report

## Run-to-run gene program consistency
DeepSearch run pairs are generally stable: the combined similarity metric (50 % gene-set Jaccard, 50 % name overlap) ranges from ~0.24 to ~0.54. Gliosis, Proliferative 2, and AC-gliosis-like 1 display the tightest reproducibility, while mixed OPC/NPC states fluctuate more, with higher fractions of unmatched programs. These results reinforce the need to treat program-level interpretations as probabilistic, especially in lineage-plastic contexts.

## GO enrichment coverage
All but one comparison file reports complete GO coverage: DeepSearch captured every GO term listed in the GSEA output, except for the Proliferative 2 model where 30 umbrella DNA-metabolism terms remained unmatched (76 % coverage). The gliosis-hypoxia and OPC-like 1 comparison markdowns still lack standardized tables, so those gene sets are excluded from the aggregate coverage stats.

![GO coverage](../analysis/go_coverage.svg)

## Methods
- DeepSearch outputs (`run_1.md`, `run_2.md`) were parsed via `scripts/process_deepsearch.py`, which extracts program metadata, supporting genes, and similarity metrics. Name similarity uses token overlap, weighted equally with gene-set Jaccard.
- GO comparison tables were ingested with `scripts/process_comparisons.py`, which reads the curated Markdown tables in `Comparisons/`. Coverage percentages reflect those tables.
- Visualizations (`analysis/run_consistency.svg`, `analysis/go_coverage.svg`) are generated by the notebook `analysis/deepsearch_consistency.ipynb`, which consumes the CSVs written by the scripts above. Bubble plots of run-to-run overlaps use `scripts/generate_heatmaps.py` (Agg backend) and land in `analysis/confusion_heatmaps/`.

## Novel gene programs without GO counterparts
Ranked by the number of supporting genes (DeepSearch run 1).

| Annotation | Program | Supporting genes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OPC-like 2 | Lipid Metabolism and Membrane Remodeling | 12 |
| NPC-neuronal-like 2 | Glioma Stem Cell Maintenance and Therapy Resistance | 8 |
| NPC-neuronal-like 1 | Transcriptional Regulation and Chromatin Remodeling | 7 |
| OPC-like 2 | Hypoxia Response and Angiogenic Signaling | 7 |
| AC-neuronal-like | Glioblastoma Immune Suppression | 6 |
| OPC-like 2 | Amino Acid Metabolism and Nutrient Transport | 6 |
| AC-gliosis-like 1 | Angiogenesis and Vascular Remodeling | 5 |
| NPC-neuronal-like 1 | GABAergic Neurotransmission | 5 |
| NPC-neuronal-like 1 | cAMP Signaling and Kinase Cascades | 4 |
| OPC-NPC-like | Sonic Hedgehog and GLI Signaling | 4 |

## Limitations and notes
- Comparison sets 9 (gliosis-hypoxia) and 12 (OPC-like 1) lack the required GO table, so they’re omitted from GO coverage metrics.
- Duplicate DeepSearch runs (identical program lists) are automatically detected and omitted from the similarity plot.
- The 50 / 50 similarity metric is heuristic: name changes between runs still rely on gene overlap to link programs.

## Duplicated runs
- NPC-neuronal-like 3 (12_NPC-neuronal-like_3): DeepSearch runs are identical; only run_1 is shown.
- OPC-AC-like 2 (14_OPC-AC-like_2): DeepSearch runs are identical; only run_1 is shown.
