## Project: glioblastoma_perplexity_manual

- Source: Table S10 from de Jong et al. (migrated from `media-3 (2).xlsx`), DeepSearch runs renamed via `run_file_mapping.csv`, and GO comparison markdowns.
- Goal: evaluate DeepSearch pseudo-enrichment programs for glioblastoma-related metamodules, compare run-to-run consistency, and map programs to GO enrichment terms.
- Inputs live under `deepsearch/glioblastoma_perplexity_manual/` and `Comparisons/glioblastoma_perplexity_manual/`; outputs and reports are scoped to `data/`, `analysis/`, and `reports/` subdirectories for this project.
