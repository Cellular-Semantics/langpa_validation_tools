compare the results to standard GSEA results for the same gene set.  Which of the programs are reflected in the GO enrichment terms. What novelties does the deepsearch find that are not identified in GSEA.  Present the results as a table of gene programs uncovered by DeepSearch with columns for similar GO terms from the enrichment list and novel aspects of deepsearch results compared to GSEA results.  Separate to the table, list GO enrichment terms NOT reflected in deepsearch gene program results.  GSEA GO TERM LIST
